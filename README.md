- ðŸ”­ My main research interests are computer vision, computer graphics, multimodal learning, and humanâ€“computer interaction. I am especially interested in controllable and interactive image synthesis. I am currently working on generating 2D images or 3D shapes from multi-modal inputs such as sketches, semantic labels, control vectors, and textual descriptions. 

- âœ¨ Recently, Iâ€™m learning the [Data Bias and Efficiency](https://github.com/weihaox/awesome-image-translation/blob/master/content/data-efficiency.md#data-efficiency) and [AI Fairness, Privacy, and Transparency](https://github.com/weihaox/awesome-image-translation/blob/master/content/data-efficiency.md#fairness-accountability-privacy-transparency-and-ethics) in generation tasks.

- ðŸŒ± The ultimate vision of my research is to manifest the physical world through imagination.
